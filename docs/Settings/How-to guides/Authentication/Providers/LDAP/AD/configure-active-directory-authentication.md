:::(Info) (Info)
It's possible to register multiple Active Directory servers in senhasegura, assigning them a priority order. senhasegura uses this order to authenticate users, attempting to log in first to the highest-priority server. If the first authentication attempt fails, the system moves on to the next server in the list and so on. If login fails on all registered AD servers, the user receives a notification stating that senhasegura was unable to authenticate their access.
