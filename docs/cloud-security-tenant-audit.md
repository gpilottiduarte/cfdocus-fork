Cloud Security provides an Audit report to track all user actions within tenants. This report helps you monitor changes that occurred in a tenant.



## Tenant audit report

The tenant audit report offers you the following information about actions performed:


|Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**Product** |The **Product** column displays the name of the specific product where the action took place. |
| **User** | In the **User** column, you find the user responsible for the action.  |
| **Event** | The **Event** column describes the specific action that the user performed. Possible values include: *Update User Roles*, *Invite User*, *Enable User in Tenant*, and *Disable User in Tenant*. |
| **Entity type** | The **Entity Type** column specifies the type of entity that underwent a change. 
**Entity** |The **Entity** column displays the name of the entity that was altered. 
| **Entity ID** | The **Entity ID** column provides the ID of the Entity that was altered.  |
| **Date**| The **Date** column indicates the exact timestamp when the action occurred.  |


:::(Info) (Info)
A user can change the entityâ€™s name, but the ID of the entity remains always the same. This ensures that changes can be traced back to the original entity.

You can open detailed information about the changes made. To perform this action, click on the action row in the report. This action will open a `JSON` file that displays both the state before and after the modification.
