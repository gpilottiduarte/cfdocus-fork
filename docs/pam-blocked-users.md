As we explain in the operation of proxies, a user can have their interactivity blocked and remain blocked until an administrator decides to release usage.

This lock prevents the user from starting new sessions regardless of credential, device, or proxy technology.

To list blocked users, and release them if necessary, go to the **Access control âž” Blocked users** report.
