This guide explains the steps necessary to effectively navigate and participate in remote sessions.

2. On the side menu, select **Access Control > Remote Sessions**.

## Remote session options

On the **Action** column, chose one of the following options:

- **LiveStream**: observe the session in real time.    
:::(Info) (Info)
This action is contingent upon the session's configuration allowing recording. For specific instructions on configuring this feature, consult the device documentation.    
:::
* **Hold On**: temporarily pause user interaction within the session. The pausing occurs within the LiveStream.  
:::(Info)
In clustered environments, tracking a remote session might not be possible if the end user logs onto the secondary server while the administrator logs onto the primary server. 
:::    
* **Drop Session**: instantaneously terminate the session.
* **Prevent Purge**: access to prevent the automatic purging  of the session's data.
* **Configure Auditors**: Selecting this option sends an email notification to the assigned user. This user can then review the session, which can be accessed via **Access Control > Session for Audit**.
