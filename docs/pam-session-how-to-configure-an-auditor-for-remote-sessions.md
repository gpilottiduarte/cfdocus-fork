## Configure an auditor

1. On the senhasegura platform, in the top left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **PAM Core**.
2. In the side menu, select **Access Control** > **Remote Sessions**.
3. In column **Action**, click on the icon represented by the three vertical dots and select **Configure auditors**.
4. In the **Session auditors settings** window.
    1. Click the **plus** icon to select the users you want to add to the list.
    2. Click the **trash bin** icon next to the selected user to **delete** a user from the list.
5. Click **Save**.

The system displays a confirmation message. Now, this session has an auditor, and they’ll be able to see the sessions in which they’re an auditor through the report **Sessions for audit**.
