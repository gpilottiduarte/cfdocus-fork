A credential policy is a set of rules that regulate how an organization manages user authentication credentials. These policies should specify rules for password complexity, expiration, and storage, among other aspects, ensuring that user credentials are robust, secure, and updated frequently, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized access to the system.

## How to create a credential policy in senhasegura

1. In the top left corner, click , represented by the nine squares, and select .
2. In the side menu, select .
3. Click the View actions icon, represented by the three vertical dots, and select .

A pop-up window called  will open. Fill in the fields accordingly:

1. : a name that will identify the credential policy on the platform.
2. : select  to keep the policy active on the platform.
3. On the  tab:
    1. : in the drop-down menu, select the password strength criteria you want. You can register the criteria for .
    2. : defines the priority for applying the policy if senhasegura finds more than one policy that applies to the credential. The higher the priority, the higher the number in this field.
    3. : the password can be viewed simultaneously. Regardless of which user has custody of the password, all others belonging to this policy can view the password.
    4. : enabling this option allows users to perform proxy sessions simultaneously with the same credential. With this option disabled, only one session will be allowed at a time.
    5. : the interval in which senhasegura will automatically change the password after a user has viewed it. In the first field, enter a number; in the second field, enter the unit (Months, Days, Hours, or Minutes).
    6.  defines the maximum period of validity for a password, starting from the last time it was changed. After the defined period, the password will expire automatically, regardless of frequency of use, including logins and remote sessions. The user will be required to choose a new password to continue accessing the system. Example: If you set this field to *3 Months*, the user's password will expire 3 months after the last password change, even if they use it regularly for any type of access, including remote sessions. In the first field, enter a number; in the second field, enter the unit (*Months, Days, Hours, or Minutes*).
    7. : establishes how long credentials from the same policy receive the same password. The count starts when the first password change for a credential occurs in that policy. For example, if the field has a time limit of five hours, all the other credentials that carry out change executions within this period will receive the same password. In the first field, enter a number; in the second field, enter the unit (*Months, Days, Hours, or Minutes*).

:::(Error) (Important)
* When the  option is enabled, and a user withdraws the password, which will cause the password to remain in their custody, another user will still be able to withdraw the password.
* When the  option is enabled, and a user withdraws the password, which will cause the password to remain in their custody, another user will not be able to withdraw the password.

5. In the  section:
    1. : click on the  button, represented by the plus sign, to add expiration criteria per appointment time. When you click on the button, a drop-down menu will appear.
