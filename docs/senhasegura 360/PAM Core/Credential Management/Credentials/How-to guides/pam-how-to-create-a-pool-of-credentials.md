A credential pool is a set of shared credentials. You can use credential pools to simplify credential management and improve security. By centralizing credentials in a pool, administrators can better control access to credentials and apply consistent security policies to all credentials.

1. In the top left corner, click , represented by the nine squares, and select .
2. In the side menu, select .
3. On the list screen for credential pools, in the top bar, click on , represented by the three dots icon, and in the drop-down menu, select .
4. On the  registration form, fill in the following fields:
    1. : a name to identify the credential pool.

    1. Click the the sum icon next to the word .
    2. In the  modal, select the credentials you want to be part of the new credential pool.
    3. Click .
6. Click .

After saving the new pool of credentials, you'll be redirected to the list page. You can now check the pool of credentials you've created.

## How to edit a pool of credentials

## Pool of credentials and discovery

The creation of the credential pool helps automate the  process, in which senhasegura may need to authenticate itself on certain devices. When authentication is unsuccessful with a specific credential, senhasegura automatically moves on to the next available credential in the pool. This procedure is repeated until authentication is successful. This eliminates the need to create several independent discovery processes, simplifying administration and making the process more efficient.
