The primary purpose of Task Manager is to allow users to run tasks with minimal privileged access. The module removes the need to share credentials, grant access to a less specialized user or release privileged sessions. By managing tasks on devices, it is possible to assign only the necessary permissions for any user to carry out critical activities in the environment safely.

The main benefits of the module are:

* Application of the concept of least privilege required to perform tasks.
* Automating privileged tasks with authorized configurations for executions in the environment.
* Safe execution of critical-level tasks that will be performed on devices by less specialized resources.

SSH, Telnet, RDP, VNC, RPC, WMI, LDAPS and HTTPS, X11 protocols are supported.
